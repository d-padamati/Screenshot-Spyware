# Remote-monitoring POC — *SANITIZED* (Educational / Lab only)

**Purpose:** This repository contains a *sanitized* educational proof-of-concept used to demonstrate how remote-monitoring behavior appears to defenders. The functional payload has been removed. This repo is intended for security education and defensive research only.

**Important:** Do NOT use any code from this repository on devices you do not own or without explicit written consent. Misuse may be illegal.

**What this repo contains:**
- Architecture diagrams and defensive notes.
- A simulator module that generates fake screenshots and logs for demo purposes (no real keylogging or exfiltration).
- Detection checklist and remediation guide.

**If you want to reproduce safely:**
- Use a virtual machine or emulator and synthetic test accounts.
- Do not distribute binaries or payloads.
